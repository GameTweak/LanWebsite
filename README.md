# LanWebsite

This was a the final Exams project for College360

The code code in this project is very rough and was not built with any
code principle in mind besides the ones I've picked up from experience

I can't quite remember what the requirements of the project was, other
than we was supposed to make a website that had interative elements both
visually and functionally, as well as using a database we made in SSMS. 

We decided on making a Lan Party website where you could book seats using
an specific id. 

We decided on making it with a mix of JQuery and C# to make the page
update dynamically when a seat was reserved. 

Quite a lot of these features no longer works since the DB was deleted 
when the project ended and the focus was more in the code rather than
visuals
